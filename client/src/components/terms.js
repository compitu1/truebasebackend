Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to Truebase connections, restricting your profile visibility from search engines, or opting not to notify others of your Truebase profile update). We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it in our sole discretion, with or without notice.</p><h2 data-reactid="30">Your License to Truebase</h2><p data-reactid="31">You own the content and information that you submit or post to the Services, and you are only granting Truebase and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license.

We will obtain your consent if we want to give others the right to publish your content beyond the Services. However, if you choose to share your post as “public”, we will enable a feature that allows other Members to embed that public post onto third-party services, and we enable search engines to make that public content findable though their services. While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating it, modifying the size, layout or file type or removing metadata), we will not modify the meaning of your expression. </p><p data-reactid="36">You and Truebase agree that we may access, store, process and use any information and personal data that you provide in accordance with the terms of the <a href="/privacy" data-reactid="38">Privacy Policy</a> and your choices (including settings).
